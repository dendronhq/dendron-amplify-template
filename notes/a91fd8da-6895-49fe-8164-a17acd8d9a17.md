# Images

## Copy & Paste

Dendron automatically inserts images in your clipboard using the `> Paste Image` command. The image is saved to `${currentFileDir}/assets` by default.

## Inserting Saved Images

An easy way to insert an image which is saved locally to your markdown note is to do the following:

- Copy / save the image in your `assets/images` folder located in your vault,
- In Dendron navigate to the note where you wish to input the image(s), and type:
- `![Image_Description](assets/images/File_Name.png)`
  - Be sure to replace `Image_Description` and `File_Name.png` with the description of the image and the actual filename
