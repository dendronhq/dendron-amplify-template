# Principles and Values

## Goals

Come up with governing principals and values for the Dendron product and the Dendron Community. This item is complete and documented under [dendron.principles](7fcebd7d-6411-4c9d-8baf-65629dc018a1)

## Details

### Product Principles

- speed: Dendron should be the fastest way for **people** to access the information they care about
  - lookup should finish in under a second
  - all parts of our toolchain should optimize for speed
- ownership: users should have **full control** of their data and it should be our first principle to maximize this as much as possibility
- interoperability: it should be possible to import/export your data from/to any other source where a user might want to use their information
- easy to learn, hard to master: see [Bushnell's Law
  ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushnell%27s_Law#:~:text=Bushnell's%20Law%20or%20Nolan's%20Law,first%20quarter%20and%20the%20hundredth.)

### Community Values

- open and inclusive: Dendron is a tool for **all users** that are interested in creating, building, using, and sharing knowledge. full stop. 
- documentation first: we don't just share what we learn in a chat at a moment in time. we make sure that the information remains accessible longer after we are gone. we do this by documenting useful information in [dendron](http://dendron.so/)
- have it in writing

### Tradeoffs

You can't have something that is everything for everyone. While both characteristics matter, we agree to make these tradeoffs when necessary. 

- function over form    
  - in dendron, its more important for something to be useful than it is to be beautiful 
  - the focus in dendron should be about your content and the hierarchies that connect them
- focus on speed
  - we can't predict the future but its likely that no one will ever say that they wish their note taking experience to be slower
  - when thinking about features and tool chain, bias for speed
- focus on hierarchies
  - while dendron supports backlinks and other forms of organizing notes, dendron's foundation is tooling to help you manage hierarchies
- retrieval over insertion @kpathakota
