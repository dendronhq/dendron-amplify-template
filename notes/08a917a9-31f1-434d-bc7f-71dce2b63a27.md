Seeds represent existing knowledge out in the world. A seed could be a wikipedia article, a github repo, or an arbitrary website. 

You can use a **Dendron Seed** to ingest data from existing sources and import them into your vault. Data ingestion is also referred to as **planting**.

Note that seeds differ from [pods](66727a39-d0a7-449b-a10d-f6c438185d7f) in that they help you ingest content from external sources from content that you might have no control over. Pods help you import/export your content between various platforms.

You can see an example of a published seeded vault [here](https://aws.dendron.so/).

# DendronSeed

Base class to extend from when creating a new seed. Documentation is still under construction. In the meanwhile, you can use [the code](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/seeds-core/src/base.ts#L39) as a guide when creating a new seed.

You can see an example of a seed implementation [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/seeds.aws/blob/master/packages/awsgeek-seed/src/index.ts#L63:L63)
