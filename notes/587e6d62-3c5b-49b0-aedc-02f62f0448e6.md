# Graph View

Dendron provides support for graph view using a fork of the [markdown-links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tchayen.markdown-links) extension. 

The Dendron graph view is generated using our hierarchical index. It also shows different relationships than most of the graph views you're probably used to.

Instead of showing edges as links between nodes, Dendron edges are the hierarchical relationships between your notes. Think of it as a 20,000 foot view of the structure of your knowledge base. 

Note that this command is not optimized for performance and you might notice slowdowns if you have more than a few hundred notes. If you are running into performance issues, please upvote this [issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/107) to prioritize the performance work!

### Dendron: Reload Graphs
