# Contribute

## Documentation

If you would like to contribute to the docs, you can do so one of two ways.

1. Click `Edit this page on github` at the bottom left corner of every page. This is recommended way of making a change. The only pre-requisite is that you have a [github](https://github.com/) account.
   <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/4a1b67f3fd1a40dab16949e9ea5e53dc"> <img style="" src="https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/4a1b67f3fd1a40dab16949e9ea5e53dc-with-play.gif"> </a>
2. For more involved changes, you can clone our github [repo](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-template) and opening `dendron.code-workspace` using VSCode.  [Dendron.so](https://www.dendron.so) is built from the contents of `vault/dendron.*`. Make a change in the corresponding file and send us a pull request to update the documentation. You can preview your changes using the `Dendron Markdown Enhanced` extension.

Images

- if you're adding an image along with the documentation, you can [imgur](https://imgur.com/upload) to upload
- note that you'll want to copy the **image link** and not the link to the imgur website

Gifs

- uploading gifs is the same process as uploading images
- to create gifs, we recommend using the [Kap](https://getkap.co/) app or making a [Loom video](http://loom.com/)
- if you are making a gif from within vscode, please turn on [screencast mode](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/vs-code-screencast-mode) so we can see what awesome keyboard shortcuts you're using :)
